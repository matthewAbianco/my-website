            <p class="intro-statement-text">Hello! And welcome to my website. This website was created to help me
                 put what i have been learning into practice. I'm sure anyone who has tried to learn coding can understand that. 
                 So this website will be an assortment of things i have learned and have wanted to learn how to impliment or create on my own. 
                 And not have a overarching reason for some things existing other than it was beneficial for me to create it for my learning. 
                 This website will over go some to many changes. Hopefully you come back to see the diffrence for yourself.
